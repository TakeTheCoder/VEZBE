      <b>Glasgow</b> grew from a small rural settlement 
      on the River Clyde to become the largest seaport in Britain. 
      Expanding from the medieval bishopric and royal burgh, 
      and the later establishment of the University of 
      <b>Glasgow</b> in the fifteenth century, 
      it became a major centre of the 
      <i>Scottish Enlightenment</i> 
      in the eighteenth century. From the eighteenth century onwards, 
      the city also grew as one of Great Britain's main hubs of 
      transatlantic trade with North America and the West Indies.
